# 🏡 TripHaven

**TripHaven** is a modern full-stack web application inspired by **Airbnb**, built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** with **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety.

The platform allows users to list, discover, and manage vacation rentals — offering the core Airbnb-like experience (without payments).
